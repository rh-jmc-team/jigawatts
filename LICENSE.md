Linking JavaCRIU statically or dynamically with other modules
is making a combined work based on JavaCRIU.  Thus, the terms
and conditions of the GPL cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of JavaCRIU give you
permission to link this code with independent modules to produce an
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from
or based on JavaCRIU code.  If you modify JavaCRIU, you may
extend this exception to your version of the software, but you are
not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this
exception statement from your version.
